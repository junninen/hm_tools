%todo list for HMTools

saving structures - DONE 4.6.07  HJ
load previous work - DONE 4.6.07 HJ
extracting and saving event classification 
extracting and saving growth rate information
Add mobility axies to AIS, BSMA, NAIS plots
Load BSMA files also from 2E-format
BSMA plotting for many days
code prctile, not to use statistics toolbox - DONE 4.6.07 copied form stat_toolbox
AIS classifications - DONE 4.6.07 HJ
Event start(time,size)-end(time,size)

partly bad swithes off when classification is not made
(eventClass field is not created if only partlybad is selected) - DONE 4.6.07 HJ

AIS data shifted by 2hours??? Ask Marko if UTC correction changed

hm_plot: check if all days are present, and if not ignore it,  but still plot whats there DONE 5.6.07 HJ
hm_smoothing: loop it through many days if needed DONE 20.Nov.2007 HJ

hm_mf: write fitting parameters and algorithm to fits field

make history function, save each command that modifies the structure DONE 20.Nov.2007 HJ
make undo function hm_reset
make test data, and commmand set to easy bug -finding
put inside hm_load function diameter conversion, actually but separate field for different mobilites!

define raw data and anaysed data path
add switch to hm_load to load raw or analysed data
add raw/analysed path to parameter file

check classification in eventClassifier
